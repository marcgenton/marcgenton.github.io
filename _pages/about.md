<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am the Al-Khawarizmi Distinguished Professor of Statistics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I lead the Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Data Science (STSDS) research group.

My research interests include **spatio-temporal statistics**, **computational statistics**, **HPC**, and **skewed non-Gaussian multivariate distributions**, with applications in **Environmental and Climate Sciences**, as well as **renewable energy**.
