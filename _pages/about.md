<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am the Al-Khawarizmi Distinguished Professor of Statistics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I lead the Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Data Science (STSDS) research group.

My research interests include **spatio-temporal statistics**, **subsampling methods**, **nonparametric statistics**, and **Computational Statistics and HPC**. My work primarily focuses on spatio-temporal statistics, particularly in the analysis of large-scale spatio-temporal data from Climate and Environmental Sciences and the development of large- and exa-scale climate emulators, with Gaussian processes being key tools. I have also developed subsampling techniques for various data types and statistical models, with an emphasis on nonparametric statistics.
